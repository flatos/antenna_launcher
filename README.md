# Pneumatic Antenna Launcher

My design for a pneunatic antenna launcher.

Based on the many pre-existing designs on the web (see links at end). 
My goals were minimal component cost and simplicity, not necessarily maximum performance.

This repository contains a detailed description of construction, plus Solidworks and STL files for a few 3d-printed components.

> [!CAUTION]
> Plenty of people have successfully built and used similar launchers.\
> Then again, there are also people who warn against using PVC pipe in compressed-air applications.\
> The Schedule 40 PVC pipe used in the air tank of this design is rated at 280 psi, and I generally charge it to 25-50 psi.\
> Review cautionary material such as the following before proceeding:  [Can PVC Pipe Be Used for Compressed Air?](https://fluidairedynamics.com/blogs/articles/can-pvc-pipe-be-used-for-compressed-air)
