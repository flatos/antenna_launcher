# Pneumatic Antenna Launcher

My design for a pneunatic antenna launcher.

Based on the many pre-existing designs on the web (see links at end). 
My goals were minimal component cost and simplicity, not necessarily maximum performance.

This repository contains a detailed description of construction, plus Solidworks and STL files for a few 3d-printed components.

> [!CAUTION]
> Plenty of people have successfully built and used similar launchers.\
> Then again, there are also people who warn against using PVC pipe in compressed-air applications.\
> The Schedule 40 PVC pipe used in the air tank of this design is rated at 280 psi, and I generally charge it to 25-50 psi.\
> Review cautionary material such as the following before proceeding:  [Can PVC Pipe Be Used for Compressed Air?](https://fluidairedynamics.com/blogs/articles/can-pvc-pipe-be-used-for-compressed-air)


## Construction

| | Qty | Desc | Source |
| :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | 20in | 1" PVC pipe, Sch 40 | Home Depot, etc.  $2.96 |
| 2 | 2 | Reel clamp | Reel_Clamp.STL |
| 3 | 2 | PVC Male Adapter, MNPT x Socket, 1 in | Zoro G5275094 $0.67 |
| 4 | 1 | Orbit 57461 1" FPT Jar Top Automatic Sprinkler Valve | Amazon $16.48 |
| 5 | 2in | 1" PVC pipe, Sch 40 |  |
| 6 | 1 | Connector clamp | Connector_Clamp.STL |
| 7 | 1 | GASHER 1/8" NPT Tank Valve, Brass | Amazon $6.95 (pkg of 2) |
| 8 | 1 | PVC Reducing Bushing, Spigot x Socket, 2 in x 1 in Pipe Size | Zoro G5278752 $1.45 |
| 9 | 1 | PVC Coupling, Socket x Socket, 2 in | Zoro G5276433 $2.25 |
| 10 | 24in | 2" PVC pipe, Sch 40 | Home Depot, etc.  $4.94 |
| 11 | 1 | PVC Cap, Socket, 2 in Pipe Size | Zoro G5275225 $1.49 |


Assemble PVC components with the appropriate primer and cement. I used `Weld-On 15900 Twin Pack 780 PVC Regular-Bodied Plumbing Solvent Cement and Purple Plumbing Primer` (Amazon $8.34).

Use yellow Teflon tape on threaded connections. e.g. `Eastman 1/2 Inch x 260 Inch Teflon Pipe Thread for Gas Lines, 4 mil` (Amazon $2.20).


## Projectile ("Spud")

| | Qty | Desc | Source |
| :---: | :---: | --- | --- |
| 1 | 2 | End cap | End_Cap_v3a.STL |
| 2 | 2.5in | 1/2" PVC pipe, Sch 40 | Home Depot, etc.  $1.56 / 24in |

I attached the end caps using self-tapping screws to allow experimenting with additional weight.\
I haven't found this to be necessary, though; the basic 0.7oz spud seems to work fine.

Material cost for each projectile is around $0.25, so you can afford to lose a few in the trees....

The end caps feature a loop to tie the fishing line to without any additional hardware.
